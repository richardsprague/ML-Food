# Data Science Food Recipes Example

This code is based on an example project presented at the [Cognitive Builder Faire](https://cognitivebuilder.github.io/) in Seattle on March 26, 2017.


See the [speaker slides and notes](https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/DataScienceFoodRecipes) for more details.

So far all I've done is convert the original code so that it works under RStudio.
